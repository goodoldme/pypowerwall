## pyPowerwall Proxy Release Notes

### Proxy t83 (5 Oct 2025)

* dd curl to Dockerfiles to use in healthchecks instead of wget by @goodoldme in http://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/223.

### Proxy t82 (6 Sep 2025)

* **Enhanced Control API**: Added new `/control` routes for grid charging and export management
  - **GET `/control/grid_charging`**: Retrieve current grid charging configuration and status
  - **POST `/control/grid_charging`**: Enable/disable grid charging with configurable parameters
  - **GET `/control/grid_export`**: Get current grid export settings and state
  - **POST `/control/grid_export`**: Control grid export behavior and limits
  - Provides comprehensive control over Powerwall grid interaction modes for advanced energy management

### Proxy t81 (9 Aug 2025)

* Improve error logging: show poll() target URI on bad payload (TypeError) instead of generic message.
* Build descriptive function/endpoint name only when an error occurs (no added overhead on success path).
* Refactor safe_pw_call exception handlers to remove redundant code. No API or config changes.

### Proxy t80 (24 Jul 2025)

* **Connection Health Robustness Fix** ([#651](https://github.com/jasonacox/Powerwall-Dashboard/issues/651#issuecomment-3114228456)):
  - Fixed issue where `consecutive_failures` in connection health tracking could reset to zero even when the Powerwall connection was not restored.
  - Now, health tracking only resets on true, fresh connection success (not when returning cached or fallback responses).
  - Prevents misleading health status and ensures degraded mode is only exited after real network/API recovery.
  - Improves reliability of `/health` and monitoring endpoints under extended network outages or degraded conditions.

* **Internal Refactoring**:
  - Audited and updated health tracking logic in `safe_pw_call` and `safe_endpoint_call` wrappers to ensure correct behavior.
  - No user-facing API changes, but improved accuracy for health metrics and logs.

* **Documentation**:
  - Updated release notes to clarify health tracking behavior and robustness improvements for network error handling.


### Proxy t79 (16 Jul 2025)

* **Enhanced Health Endpoint**: Added pypowerwall version and proxy build information to `/health` endpoint for better version tracking and debugging
  - Health response now includes: `"pypowerwall": "0.13.2 Proxy t79"` combining version and build info in consistent format

* **Code Quality**: Added flake8 configuration (`.flake8`) and cleaned up trailing whitespace issues
  - Configured to ignore common acceptable lint errors (E501, W503, E722)
  - Fixed trailing whitespace issues throughout proxy codebase

### Proxy t78 (14 Jul 2025)

* Power flow animation update: Show an image of a Powerwall 3 instead of a Powerwall 2 if it is a PW3 by @JEMcats in https://github.com/jasonacox/pypowerwall/pull/193

### Proxy t77 (11 Jul 2025)

* **TEDAPI Lock Optimization and Error Handling**: Enhanced proxy stability and performance with comprehensive fixes for TEDAPI-related issues.
  - **Fixed KeyError exceptions** in proxy server when status response missing `version` or `git_hash` keys by implementing defensive key access with `.get()` method
  - **Fixed KeyError exceptions** when auth dictionary missing `AuthCookie` or `UserRecord` keys in cookie mode, now uses safe fallbacks
  - **TEDAPI Performance Improvements**: Optimized core TEDAPI functions (`get_config`, `get_status`, `get_device_controller`, `get_firmware_version`, `get_components`, `get_battery_block`) with cache-before-lock pattern to reduce lock contention
  - **Removed redundant API calls** in TEDAPI wrapper functions to improve response times
  - **Enhanced multi-threading support** for concurrent proxy requests with reduced lock timeout errors
  - **Improved error resilience** for different connection modes (local vs TEDAPI) that return varying data structures

* **Enhanced Health Monitoring**: Added comprehensive endpoint statistics tracking for better observability and debugging.
  - **Endpoint Call Statistics**: Added tracking of successful and failed API calls per endpoint with success rate calculations
  - **Enhanced `/health` endpoint**: Now includes detailed statistics showing:
    - Total calls, successful calls, and failed calls per endpoint
    - Success rate percentage for each endpoint
    - Time since last success and last failure for each endpoint
    - Overall proxy response counters (total_gets, total_posts, total_errors, total_timeouts)
  - **Improved `/health/reset` endpoint**: Now also clears endpoint statistics along with health counters and cache
  - **Automatic tracking**: All endpoints using `safe_endpoint_call()` automatically tracked (includes `/aggregates`, `/soe`, `/vitals`, `/strings`, etc.)

### Proxy t76 (6 Jul 2025)

* **Advanced Network Robustness Features**: Added comprehensive connection health monitoring and graceful degradation for improved reliability under poor network conditions, especially for frequent polling scenarios (e.g., telegraf every 5s).

  - **Connection Health Monitoring** (`PW_HEALTH_CHECK=yes`, default enabled):
    - Tracks consecutive failures, total error/success counts, and connection status
    - Automatically enters "degraded mode" after 5 consecutive failures
    - Exits degraded mode after 3 consecutive successes
    - Provides health status via `/health` endpoint for external monitoring

  - **Fail-Fast Mode** (`PW_FAIL_FAST=yes`, default disabled):
    - When connection is in degraded state, immediately returns cached/empty data
    - Prevents timeout delays for rapid polling scenarios
    - Reduces system load during extended network outages

  - **Graceful Degradation** (`PW_GRACEFUL_DEGRADATION=yes`, default enabled):
    - Maintains cache of last successful responses (TTL: 5 minutes)
    - Returns cached data when fresh data is unavailable
    - Ensures telegraf and other pollers receive valid data structures even during outages
    - Automatic cache size management (max 50 entries)

  - **Telegraf-Optimized Fallbacks**:
    - `/aggregates` returns minimal valid power structure on failure
    - `/soe` returns `{"percentage": 0}` on failure
    - CSV endpoints return zero values instead of empty responses
    - Maintains data type consistency for monitoring tools

  - **Enhanced API Endpoints**:
    - `/health` - Connection health status and feature configuration
    - `/health/reset` - Reset health counters and clear cache
    - `/stats` - Now includes connection health metrics when enabled

  - **Improved Error Handling**:
    - Enhanced `safe_pw_call()` with health tracking integration
    - New `safe_endpoint_call()` wrapper with automatic caching for JSON endpoints
    - Better separation of network vs API errors for targeted handling

  - **Configuration Options**:
    - `PW_FAIL_FAST=yes/no` - Enable fail-fast mode (default: no)
    - `PW_GRACEFUL_DEGRADATION=yes/no` - Enable cached fallbacks (default: yes)  
    - `PW_HEALTH_CHECK=yes/no` - Enable health monitoring (default: yes)

  - **Operational Benefits**:
    - Reduced timeout delays during network issues (fail-fast mode)
    - Improved telegraf reliability with consistent data structures
    - Better visibility into connection issues via health endpoints
    - Automatic recovery detection and logging
    - Memory-efficient caching with automatic cleanup

* **Weak WiFi / Network Error Optimization**: Added specialized handling for environments with poor network connectivity.
  - **Enhanced Exception Coverage**: Now catches all requests and urllib3 timeout/connection exceptions (ReadTimeout, ConnectTimeout, MaxRetryError, etc.)
  - **Rate Limiting**: Network errors are rate-limited to prevent log spam (default: 5 errors per minute per function)
  - **Summary Reporting**: Periodic summary reports (every 5 minutes) show network error counts instead of individual error logs
  - **Configurable Suppression**: 
    - `PW_SUPPRESS_NETWORK_ERRORS=yes` - Completely suppress individual network error logs (summary only)
    - `PW_NETWORK_ERROR_RATE_LIMIT=N` - Set max network errors logged per minute per function (default: 5)
  - **Thread Safety**: Added proper locking for all global statistics and error tracking
  - **Log Level Optimization**: Network errors use INFO level, API errors use WARNING level to reduce noise

* **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implemented global exception handling for all pypowerwall function calls to provide clean error logging instead of deep stack traces.
  - Added `safe_pw_call()` wrapper function that catches and handles pypowerwall-specific exceptions
  - Catches connection errors (ConnectionError, TimeoutError, OSError) and logs descriptive messages
  - Catches pypowerwall API exceptions (InvalidConfigurationParameter, TEDAPI, FleetAPI errors)
  - Maintains API functionality through graceful error responses (returns "TIMEOUT!" for failed calls)
  - Improves debugging with clean, descriptive error messages identifying the failing function
  - Error Statistics: Automatically increments `proxystats['errors']` for API errors and `proxystats['timeout']` for connection/timeout errors
  - Example log messages: `"Powerwall API Error in poll: Connection timeout"`, `"Connection Error in vitals: Network unreachable"`
